    <h2>History of Papa Roach</h2>
      <p>The formation of Papa Roach began in January 1993, when lead singer Jacoby Shaddix and drummer Dave Buckner met on the Vacaville High School football field, where the two ended up talking about music. They were later joined by lead guitarist Jerry Horton from nearby Vanden High School (Horton was introduced to the band through his girlfriend), trombonist and rhythm guitarist Ben Luther and bass guitarist "Homie" Will James. They decided to enter the school's talent show, where they performed a version of Jimi Hendrix's song "Fire", but they<img class="right-column" src="angry papa.jpeg"> ultimately did not win the contest. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band. At this point, Papa Roach were practicing every day and touring, playing every gig they could get. Their first tour van was called Moby Dick, where Jacoby was inspired to come up with his first stage name "Coby Dick". The band's name comes from Shaddix's step-grandfather, Howard William Roatch, who was nicknamed Papa Roach.[citation needed] Roatch committed suicide in 2006 after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The band pays homage to him with The Paramour Sessions and during live performances of the song "Roses On My Grave".</p>
